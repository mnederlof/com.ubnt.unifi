# Ubiquiti UniFi Controller
This app adds support for presence detection based on (wifi) clients connected to the UniFi Controller on your Homey.

Device triggers:
* Wifi device (dis-)connected
* Wifi device roams from one Accesspoint to any another
* Wifi device roams to specific Accesspoint

Device conditions:
* Wifi client is (dis-)connected
* Wifi client is (dis-)connected from accesspoint

Generic triggers:
* A client (dis-)connected
* First device is connected
* First device is connected to specific accesspoint
* Last device has disconnected
* Last device has disconnected from specific accesspoint
* A non-paired device (guest) has (dis-)connected

Please note: only paired devices are being considered as device in all flow contexts. Non-paired devices are only usable for the guest (dis-)connected trigger.

## Geting started:
* Configure settings for UniFi Controller via Homey Settings panel.
  * If you have a custom site name, then first try default as site id. Then a list of site ids will be loaded.
* Go to Devices > Add new device wizard
* Select device you want to pair with Homey.
  * It will only show devices known to your controller for the last 24 hours.

## Supported devices:
* Wifi devices connected to UniFi accesspoints, connected via UniFi Controller.

For supported accesspoints, see [UniFi download page](https://www.ubnt.com/download/unifi/) for more information.

This version has been tested against version 5.7.x of the Ubiquiti UniFi Controller software. Lower versions might work too, but is untested.

## Supported Languages:
* English
